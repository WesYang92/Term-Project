# Project Info
Our program is an innovative search tool that combines TheCocktailDB API with the natural language processing capabilities of OpenAI. While traditional cocktail apps only allow searching by specific ingredients such as “vodka” or “rum”, the app enhances the search experience by accepting natural language queries such as “summer fruit cocktail” or “winter warm drinks” and other natural language queries to enhance the search experience. When a user enters such a query, the app utilizes OpenAI's API to interpret the request and suggest appropriate cocktail names, which are then cross-referenced with TheCocktailDB for detailed recipes and instructions. All results are displayed in a clean, scrollable list with cocktail images and basic information.
